Our client apps run on any OS (Windows, Mac or Linux) and the OMERO.web app runs in your browser. OMERO lets you organise your data how you want using 'Projects' and 'Datasets' to manage your images. You can create tags and tag groups to annotate images with key-words of your choice. OMERO also supports rating, comments, and file attachments. Once annotated, you can browse, filter or search your images by their annotations and export a table of tag-counts for a Dataset of images. Users of OMERO can be organized into groups, each with different permissions levels, allowing you to collaborate with your colleagues. You can share and annotate the data you want with the people you want.</p>

                            <p>In OMERO, you can view your images in multiple dimensions, scrolling through Z-sections and time-points. Turn channels on and off, change channel colours and adjust rendering settings. You can also copy and paste settings between images. Viewing images remotely in OMERO is fast, because you don't need to download the whole image to view it. OMERO simply renders the planes you want and sends the rendered image to the client app. Even if you want to view a Z-projection: OMERO does the projection on the server and sends you the result. OMERO also supports 'Big' images with viewers that allow you to pan and zoom in a 'Google maps' manner.</p>

OMERO supports Python scripting, allowing you to write analysis scripts that run on the server. These scripts can be launched from the apps allowing all users to access additional functionality on the server.</p>                            
                            <p class="text-right">OMERO's open API allows client apps written in Java, Python, C++ or MATLAB to access image data and save analysis results back to the server, making OMERO a powerful platform for 3rd party analysis tools. OMERO includes a simple ImageJ plugin which allows ImageJ/Fiji to access images on OMERO.
