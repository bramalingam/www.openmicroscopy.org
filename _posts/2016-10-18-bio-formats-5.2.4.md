Today we are releasing Bio-Formats 5.2.4, a bug-fix release mainly addressing a regression that was introduced in 5.2.0.

Improvements for two formats:

*  OME-TIFF
    *  fixed regression when populating plane metadata
*  CZI
    *  populated series metadata with the scene/position information

Full details can be found at http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.2/about/whats-new.html

The software is available at:

http://downloads.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/5.2.4

and available from the Java-8 update site for Fiji users.
